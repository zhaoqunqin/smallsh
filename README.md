# smallsh
Compiled on 20.04.1-Ubuntu with command gcc *.c -o smallsh

Smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, 
such as bash. This program will:


1. Provide a prompt for running commands(:)

2. Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character

3. Provide expansion for the variable $$

4. Execute 3 commands exit , cd , and status via code built into the shell

5. Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions

6. Support input and output redirection

7. Support running commands in foreground and background processes

8. Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP
